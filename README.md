## About The Project

Suturing is a frequently used operation in most of the surgeries and developing a robotic system for autonomous robotic suturing can be of significant assistant to surgery team in order to reduce the physical fatigue and cognitive load. Since tissues are deformable objects needle insertion and tissue manipulation is a complex control task. The second complexity of the control task belongs to the high dimensional sensory data (Visual sensor) which makes the problem very hard for conventional control theory/Learning from Demonstration algorithms. We have collected a dataset for piercing needle into an artificial tissue with da Vinci Research Kit (DVRK) to develop deep LfD models for robot control.
